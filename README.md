## Building source code

### Requirements

- Java SE Development Kit (JDK) >= 1.8. Click [here](https://lumi.gq/jdk) if you don't have it.

### Build status

[![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/EQDiet/EQDietBeta0.8/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Maven/badge.svg)](https://github.com/EQDiet/EQDietBeta0.8/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Java+CI+with+Maven%22) [![Java CI with Maven Wrapper](https://github.com/EQDiet/EQDietBeta0.8/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Maven%20Wrapper/badge.svg)](https://github.com/EQDiet/EQDietBeta0.8/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Java+CI+with+Maven+Wrapper%22) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/6l4q16pbxa8lv55k?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/EQDiet/EQDietBeta-08) [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/EQDiet/GitHub/_apis/build/status/EQDiet.EQDietBeta0.8?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/EQDiet/GitHub/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)
### Procedure

1. Set Java JDK bin folder to PATH. View [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhBNV8no4CI) if you don't know how to do it (only Windows).
2. Set JAVA_HOME variable. This is the path to your java folder (e.g. `C:\Program files\Java\jdk1.8.0_251`). BE CAREFUL! It's not the bin folder (e.g. It's NOT: `C:\Program files\Java\jdk1.8.0_251\bin`). It's HIGHLY recommended to create it in the global variables as shown on the video at the step 1, but you can set it temporarily at command prompt or terminal with the `set` command.
3. Download source code by clicking "clone or download" button or by running this command:                          
`git clone https://github.com/EQDiet/EQDietBeta0.8.git` (Only if you have GIT installed)
4. Extract the files to any folder.
5. Open command prompt or terminal.
6. Go to the destination folder you have extracted the files.
7. ONLY FOR LINUX USERS. Run `chmod +x mvnw` to get gradlew execution permission
8. Run `mvnw.bat install` on Windows or `./mvnw install` on Linux. This is the full compilation method and we recommend it. However, you can run `mvnw.bat compile` on Windows or `./mvnw compile` on Linux for a quick compilation method.
9. Run `buildjar.bat` on Windows or `chmod +x buildjar && ./buildjar` on Linux to generate the JAR file (at the Release folder)
10. Download Launch4j through [this link](https://eqdiet.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/2/7/122786941/launch4j-3.12-win32.exe)
11. Install Launch4j and open it.
12. Choose "Output file" option to the folder you want and with the executable name with .exe extansion you want.
13. Choose "Jar" option to the Release folder you generated and the JAR file name with .jar extension.
14. Choose "Icon" option to the EQDiet icon you just have downloaded.
15. Go to JRE tab and write "1.8" in the "Min JRE version" option.
16. Click "Save configuration" icon.It will write a XML file. Choose the name you want. When you compile the EXE file, you can delete it.
17. Click "Build wrapper" icon.
18. Done! Check the EXE output folder you have selected and now you will have an official copy of EQDiet Beta 0.8!
